## Description
Our mission was simple: See if we could take something we knew and re-create it. With Crash Code, we removed all the unwanted noise of ads, and kept it simple.

With Crash Code you can create a profile, and start posting your code snippets. You can also view other users' code snippets, and even comment on them!
